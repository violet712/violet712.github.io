## Off-policy

$\pi(a|s) \gt 0$ where $b(a|s) \gt 0$

On-policy $\pi(a|s) = b(a|s)$

Off-policy learning allows learning an *optimal policy* from *suboptimal behavior*.

## Importance Sampling

Use *importance sampling* to estimate the expected value of a target distribution using samples from a *different distribution*.

## Off-policy Monte Carlo Prediction

## How is Q-learning off-policy

Understand how Q-learning can be off-policy without using importance sampling.

## Planning and Learning

A model allows for planning. Planning refers to the process of using a model to improve a policy.
