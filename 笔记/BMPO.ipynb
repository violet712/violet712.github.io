    "1. On-policy learning once the model is learned\n",
    "2. May not need further real interaction data once the model is learned (bacth RL)\n",
    "3. Always show higher sample efficiency than MFRL\n",

    "- Pros\n",
    "1. The best asymptotic performance\n",
    "2. Highly suitable for DL architecture with big data\n",

    "- Cons\n",
    "1. Off-policy methods still show instabilities\n",
    "2. Very low sample efficiency & require huge amount of training data"
